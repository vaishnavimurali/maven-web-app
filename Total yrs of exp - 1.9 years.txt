kubernetes:-

etcd cluster --->key value storage which is used to store the kubernetes cluster data
kube-api-server ---->serve as frontend to cluster
kube-controller-manager  ---> Runs a number of distinct controller process in background ex;app need for 4 replicas it create 4 replica...
cloud-controller-manager ---> i use eks with aws ,clound controlleer manager responsible for setup infrastructure.
kube-schedular ----> helps schedule the pods on various nodes bassd on resource utilization.
example:if the application needs 1gb of m/y and 2 cpu cores then the pods for that application
will be scheduled on node with atleast those resources.

worker node compnents:
kubelet  --> it ensures that pods and their containers are healthy and running in desired state.It reports to the master on health of host where it is running.
kube -proxy --->forward request from outside of internet to pods/container..n/w related works


kubectl --- > command line tool..ineract with kube-apiserver

pod--- one or more containers..one pod runs with  one container
service----pods are volatile...it is gateway...it does load balancing
deployment ----> above the pod..

pod:yaml file


apiVersion: v1      ---syntax 
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx  ---light weight web server
    image: nginx:1.14.2
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80

sevices yaml file 

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-nginx
  labels:
      run: my-nginx
spec:
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
    selector:
       run:my-nginx

deployment yaml file:


apiVersion: apps/   v1
kind: Deployement
metadata:
  name: my-nginx
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
       run : my-nginx
  replicas : 2
  template:
    metadata:  
      labels:
         run : my-nginx
spec:
   containers:
   -name: my-nginx
    image: nginx
    ports:
   - containerport: 80

create cluster:
eksctl create cluster -f eks-cluster-create.yaml




kubernets interview questions:


1.kubernetes is container orchetration tool
it has done auto scaling
it has gui  
it has automatic roll back to previous or nect versions
 third party tools like grafana , promethus for logging and monitoring 
  can share storage volumes with container in same pod


2.docker swarm
 orchrstrate simple docker containers  
 cant do  auto scaling
 not provide gui
 cannote deploy automatic rollback 
 require third party tools like elk stack for logging and monitoring  
  can share storage volume with any container easily 

3.kubelet:
  kubelet  --> it ensures that pods and their containers are healthy and running in desired state.It reports to the master on health of host where it is running.

4kubectl:
  command line tool
  deploying and managing application on kubernets
  interaction with cluster throug kubectl --creating,updating and deleting pods info through kubectl

5.diff services in kubenetes
cluster ip service
node port service
external name
load balancer service

6.how to set static ip for kubernetes load balancer
by changing dns records whwnever kubernetes master assign new ip address

7.etcd
etcd cluster --->key value storage which is used to store the kubernetes cluster data
it allows nodes in cluster to read and write data
it represent state of cluster at specific moment in time , center management for cluster coordination


8.replication controller
latest version of kubernetes
do not have selectors in spec  
replica set
have selectors in spec 

9.kubeproxy
